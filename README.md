# chess-puzzle-solver
This project helps you improve your puzzle rating on Chess.com. It reads your screen, converts the position into FEN notation, and solves it. However, it doesn't have 100% accuracy because the program assumes that every move the computer makes against you in the puzzle is the best move.
