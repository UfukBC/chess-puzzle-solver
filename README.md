# chess-puzzle-solver
This project helps you grind your puzzle rating on cc. It reads your screen, converts the position into FEN notation, and solves it. However, it doesn't have 100% accuracy because the program assumes that every move the computer makes against you in the puzzle is the best move.
I do not take any responsibility for those who decide to use this project or for anyone who gets banned as a result of using it. Cheating is unethical, and I believe it is against Chess.com's Fair Play Policy.
